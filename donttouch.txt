gist for you is your personal opportunity radar for Cameroon, making sure you never miss important concours, scholarships, jobs, or local happenings again. It uses trusted sources, summarizes what matters, and sends you clear, timely alerts so you can act early instead of hearing news when it is already too late. You'll scroll through curated news delivered in bite-sized summaries, and if you have questions about any gist you receive, just tap to chat with Reepls AI for instant clarifications or deeper insights. Set your preferences and we'll send you priority notifications about opportunities that match your goals. But we don't just notify you—we help you succeed! If you receive an opportunity you'd love to follow, the gist-for-you team is available anytime to take you through the process: adjusting your CV, refining your motivational letter, and why not, even applying for you if it's a job opportunity for example. Now, go through the onboarding process and don't worry—you can always adjust anything later in your user profile. Your success is our mission. Let's get started!
